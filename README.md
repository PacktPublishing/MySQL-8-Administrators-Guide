## About the Book
MySQL is one of the most popular and widely used relational databases in the world today. The recently released version 8.0 brings along some major advancements in the way your MySQL solution can be administered. This handbook will be your companion to understand the newly introduced features in MySQL and how you can leverage them to design a high-performance MySQL solution for your organization.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
CREATE TABLE working_days (
year INT,
week INT,
days BIT(7),
PRIMARY KEY (year, week));
```

We recommend that you get some basic knowledge of MySQL (any version) and SQL commands before you start reading this book.
This book also covers practical scenarios and command execution, so if possible, install a tool for easy execution of MySQL commands.
